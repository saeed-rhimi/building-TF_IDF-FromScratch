# Building TF-IDF From Scratch

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm from scratch using Python. TF-IDF is a widely-used statistical measure in text mining and information retrieval, which helps in understanding the significance of words in a document within a larger corpus.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

numpy pandas nltk

### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip:

pip install numpy pandas nltk

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (main.ipynb) in your preferred environment (like Jupyter Lab or VSCode).

## Running the Notebook

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Import Libraries**: The necessary libraries for data handling and text processing are imported.
2. **Loading Dataset**: A dataset containing text data and labels is loaded for processing.
3. **TF-IDF Implementation**: The core section where TF-IDF is implemented from scratch.
4. **Data Exploration**: Code to explore and understand the data, including checking random documents and their TF-IDF scores.

You can run the notebook cell by cell to understand the flow of data and the implementation details of the TF-IDF algorithm.
